Project Description
MooDShift is a chatbot web app that celebrates human impatience. Instead of giving instant AI replies, 
it intentionally stalls with humorous animations, quirky progress bars, and playful messages, making users laugh while they wait.

The Problem (that doesn‚Äôt exist)
In today‚Äôs world, people lose their patience if AI apps delay by even a few seconds. When ChatGPT or Gemini lags,
users spiral into frustration and boredom, expecting instant genius answers without a blink. Clearly, this impatience epidemic is a critical crisis.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We‚Äôre not solving the delay. We‚Äôre embracing it!
MooDShift makes waiting fun. It responds to questions with witty animations,
sassy progress bars, and "fake struggle" messages like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm almost there üò¢‚Äù if you try to rush it. After 60 seconds, it will even celebrate your "achievement" of waiting. 
In the end, the answer doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äîit‚Äôs about testing your patience (and humor).
